					<h1>Teaching</h1>
					<div class="image_wrapper image_fl"><img src="images/tooplate_image_02.jpg" alt="Image 01" /></div>
					<p align="justify"><em>If you ask me, teaching, much like therapy or other interpersonal activities, begins with empathy and good will. I've seen the most experienced teachers with diplomas coming out of their ears strugling to teach fairly simple things to capable students, and I've seen students progressing with supposedly mediocre teachers. I'm certainly not the right teacher for everybody, but I don't really trust profesionals who claim otherwise about themselves. That's why I suggest setting a demonstrative class.</em></p>
					<p align="justify">That being said, Viktor offers a demonstrative class for free to whoever is interested, just <a rel="nofollow" href="contact.html" target="_parent">contact us</a> and check it out. He started teaching music in 2014, focusing mostly on guitar and theory, though he taught a few bass guitar lessons too. During college he also took part in an academic program called Tutorial Education Program in wich he got involved with a number of academic researches and projects.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p align="justify">Viktor Mellow is actually a bachellor in classical music composition and his Alma Mater is UNESP, one of the most respected institutions in Brazil. This course had an emphasis on electroacoustic music wich allowed him to expand his music training to audio production as well. He also took a technical course in choral conducting.</p>

					<h2>Method</h2>
					<p align="justify">When it comes to teaching guitar my method is much like the way I study, wich means I focus on whatever the student feels the need to learn. If one feels a need to learn a specific song or technique to be happy then that's what we'll be working on.</p>
					<p align="justify"> Let's say you really need to learn Wonderwall by Oasis: It'll take some practice for a begginer but we can get there within a couple of classes and a fair amount of practice at home.</p>
					<p align="justify"> Now let's say you want to learn Painkiller by Judas Priest and you're still a begginer: Well, first of all you need to understand that this song requires skills like palm muting, alternate picking, sweep picking, pinch harmonics, bending, vibrato... in other words, we'll be practicing a small set of these skills at a time in slow tempo and since we're at it we'll learn much easier songs in the process.</p>

					<p><em>A few of the books that we recommend and use</p></em>
				</div> 

					<div class="last_content_box">
					<h2>Do I need to learn music theory/reading?</h2>
					<p align="justify">As I said before, NO. We'll focus on what you want. However, learning theory and how to read music will make your life REALLY easier in the long run, not only this, but the students who accept this fact tend to play better too. No wonder these are usually the same students that understand the importance of practicing slowly, with a metronome and regularly. But don't worry, part of learning music is actually learning how you learn.</p>
